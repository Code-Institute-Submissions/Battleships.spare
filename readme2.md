# Battleship Game
---
## Added Feature

I choose to design a classic battleship game for my python project. In the middle of designing the game
I came up with the idea of using storms (typhoons) on the board while the game went on. The storms would
travel from the top of the board down to the bottom. If a ship that already had a hit, either the COMP or users ship, 
was caught up in one of these storms the ship that was partly visible would disapear in the storm and be
hidden again and moved to a different location. So the players would have to shoot the ship down before
a typhoon came over it. If the hidden ship then would recieve another hit the ship parts that was previously
struck would be displayed again.

This was my original idea for the game. The leaderboard function is not active in the game.

**<li>Selecting 'int' in row and 'int' in column<li>**
This caused the game to crash in a while loop.<br>
